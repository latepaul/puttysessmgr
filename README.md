# Putty Session Launcher

## What it Does

Putty Session Launcher will read in putty sessions from the registry and 
create a dialog box with a tree control. 

The First 5 of these are added to a 'Favourites' category.

If you double-click on a session name it will launch putty with that session.

If you right-click it will open a dialog that will offer to change the 
category of that item. Currently that doesn't actually do anything.

## TODO

See issues.
